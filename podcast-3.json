For a long time, this was just a number in the Keys FBI files next to the words, NamUs reports case has been resolved and archived. Then in the summer of 2022, researchers Kim K. and Michelle had a discussion about the unknown NamUs numbers in the FBI files. Kim had discovered that MP5407 was in fact the missing person number assigned to Gina De Jesus, who had vanished from Cleveland, Ohio in 2004. Through further research, Michelle and Kim also determined that MP13744 likely belonged to Chioma Gray, and these two discoveries gave us new insights into Keys and his online activities. But more on that later. Most people recognize Georgina Gina De Jesus' name, as she belongs to a small subset of people who were abducted, held captive, and managed to escape. De Jesus and two other women broke free from their abductor, Ariel Castro, in May of 2013, in what the press dubbed, the miracle in Cleveland. But before that miraculous rescue, Gina was a child who was missing for nine years. A child who loved roller skating and ice skating, and singing along to all of the pop songs on the radio when her father drove her to school. On the afternoon of Friday, April 2nd, 2004, 14-year-old Gina completed another week of school and was looking forward to the weekend. She began walking home from Wilbur Wright Middle School in Cleveland, Ohio with her close friend and classmate, 13-year-old Arlene Castro. According to details from an America's Most Wanted episode featuring an interview with Arlene, at around 3pm the two stopped at a payphone about half a mile from their school. Arlene borrowed 50 cents from Gina to call her mother, Grimilda Figueroa. The girls wanted to hang out at Gina's house and have a sleepover, but Grimilda told Arlene no, the 13-year-old needed to go home. Gina said goodbye to her friend and began walking one mile to her house, which typically took 45 minutes. Usually, Gina would have ridden the bus, but she had spent some of her bus fare at lunch and for Arlene to call her mom. Arlene later told police that she last saw her friend on Lorraine Avenue near West 105th Street. At Gina's house, her mother, Nancy Ruiz, grew anxious. It was almost 4pm and she had expected her daughter to be home by 3.30 at the latest. Nancy had planned to take Gina to the mall that evening for a mother-daughter shopping trip. When Gina still hadn't returned by 4pm, Nancy decided to start looking for her daughter. She walked to the nearby corner store and asked if anyone had seen the 7th grader, and when they said no, she began calling all of her daughter's friends, but none of them knew where Gina was. Now terrified, Nancy returned to the store checking again if Gina was there, but she wasn't, and at 5.30pm, Nancy called 911. According to Nancy, the responding officer said that Gina was probably with her boyfriend. When Nancy told the officer that her daughter wasn't in a relationship with anyone, and that she wouldn't have gone anywhere without calling her mother first, the officer insisted that Gina would show up soon. Nancy explained that Gina was extremely close with her family. She lived with her parents, her brother, her sister, and her sister's two daughters. Gina was a fairly shy teenager who enjoyed spending time with her nieces and rarely spent time away from the house. Nancy knew that the 14-year-old had not left of her own volition. She asked authorities to issue an amber alert, but the officer said there was no concrete proof of an abduction. Both frustrated and frightened, Gina's family spent the evening searching. Her father Felix checked around Wilbur Wright Middle School and drove the route his daughter would have walked home. Gina's older brother Ricky also drove around looking for his sister, and at 7.30pm, the family reconvened and searched their neighborhood by foot. As the Friday night crowds left bars, they saw Gina's family searching and joined in to help. Alley's and dumpsters were scoured, but there was no sign of Gina anywhere, and no one in the DeJesus family slept that night. The next afternoon, a police lieutenant named Marge Liskowski interviewed Gina's family. Liskowski was convinced that Gina didn't run away, but when she expressed her concerns to a detective, he dismissed them. He echoed the responding officer's viewpoint that Gina was likely with a boyfriend and would return soon. Liskowski believed the detective was biased because Gina came from a lower-income neighborhood. Annoyed, she contacted a district commander, who immediately assigned a new detective to the case. Soon after, Cleveland detective Brian Hefferman learned of Gina's abduction and was shocked. For the last year, he had been investigating another teenager's disappearance from the exact same area. On April 21st of 2003, Amanda Berry vanished the day before her 17th birthday. Amanda finished her shift at Burger King and began walking home. She was talking to her sister on the phone when she said she was going to get a ride. The fast food restaurant near Lorraine Avenue and West 110th Street was only a five-minute walk up the exact same street that Gina was last seen on. Detective Hefferman jumped into action. He updated his contacts at the FBI about the latest abduction, and that Sunday, he went to interview Nancy and Felix. The investigation picked up steam and the media began covering Gina's disappearance immediately. Police dogs were able to track Gina's scent from the payphone Arlene had used to a spot near an Irish pub a short distance away. Unfortunately, that's where the trail ended. Meanwhile, a reporter introduced Gina's and Amanda's families. He figured if they got together and talked, perhaps they could find a connection between the two young women, something that might help bring them home. Investigators pursued various leads, and America's Most Wanted covered Gina's and Amanda's disappearances together over several episodes. In November of 2005, more than a year after Gina vanished, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a person of interest. The male suspect was described as Latino, 25 to 35 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighing 165 to 185 pounds, with green eyes and a goatee and possibly a pencil-thin beard. Unfortunately, nothing came of the sketch. Nancy regularly held vigils and rallies for Gina, even walking the same route her daughter disappeared from on each anniversary of her disappearance, April 2nd. And then, 19 days later, on April 21st, Amanda's family would do the same outside the Burger King that she disappeared from. The years passed with few updates, and then, in 2007, another teenager disappeared in Cleveland. As we covered in the second episode of our NamUs 45 series, Ashley Nicole Summers, whose mother's home was located within blocks of where both Barry and DeJesus vanished, disappeared in July of 2007. Like Gina, Ashley was also 14 years old, and once a student at Wilbur Wright Middle School, the same school that both Gina and Amanda had attended. The media glommed on to a possible connection, and the three cases were highlighted together, including on an episode of Oprah. And the FBI investigated whether the same person could be responsible for all three young women's disappearances. And despite the similarities and the involvement of the FBI, years passed with little to go on in each case. Throughout the ordeal, Gina's mother remained hopeful and often expressed that she believed Gina was still alive. She told the press at one vigil, I know one day my daughter will walk through the door. Nine years and 34 days after Gina DeJesus vanished, her mother's hope was fulfilled. On the evening of May 6th, 2013, neighbors of a two-story house at 2207 Seymour Avenue in Cleveland's Tremont section discovered an unfamiliar young woman pleading for help through the White House's front door. Residents joined together to help free the woman and her six-year-old daughter. Once free, she called 911 and told the dispatcher, help me. I'm Amanda Barry. I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for ten years. And I'm here and I'm free now. When the police arrived at 2207 Seymour Avenue, they discovered and rescued two more women from the home. 23-year-old Gina DeJesus and 32-year-old Michelle Knight, who now goes by Lily Rose Lee. The world was captivated by the women's miraculous escape from a home believed to be vacant, yet the details about the abuse they endured were gut-wrenching. For the crime, police arrested 52-year-old Ariel Castro, a former school bus driver and the father of Gina's friend Arlene. Castro abducted the women by offering them a ride. In Gina's case, she recognized and trusted her friend's father and accepted that ride, thinking he was going to take her home. Instead, Castro drove his victims to his Seymour Avenue residence, luring them inside and then restraining them. Chillingly, it later emerged that Castro had attended several of the vigils for Gina. He was friends with her father and tried to get even closer to the family. His son, who had studied journalism, also interviewed Gina's mother Nancy to write an article about Gina's case in 2004. The three young women experienced years of horrific physical, sexual, and emotional abuse while in captivity, and Gina's and Amanda's cases, they sat next to Ariel Castro as he watched news coverage depicting their families pleading for their safe return. This included the episodes of America's Most Wanted. While Gina, Amanda, and Lily Rose's escape is remarkable, it also highlights many issues plaguing missing persons cases. As you may recall from our episode on Ashley Nicole Summers, Lily Rose, then known as Michelle Knight, was never even reported missing, despite failing to appear at a custody hearing for her young son. In the decade that Cleveland spent looking for Amanda and Gina, they were unaware that a third young woman had also been abducted. Plus, police never issued an amber alert for Gina, and they initially dismissed her family's concerns, assuming instead that the 14-year-old had run away, despite Gina being on great terms with her family and having no history of running away. In June of 2013, in exchange for the prosecutor taking the death penalty off the table, Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts, including kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder for the unlawful termination of at least one pregnancy. The plea also spared three women from having to testify in court, which was a relief to them all. In August of 2013, a judge sentenced Castro to life in prison plus 1,000 years, a little over a month into his sentence. The asshole killed himself. And that brings us to another asshole who killed himself in prison, Israel Keyes. Almost five months to the day after Keyes' suicide, DeJesus, Knight, and Barry escaped the Seymour Avenue home. So we can say with certainty that Gina's case had nothing to do with Keyes. When Keyes came across Gina's story, no one knew that she was being held to the brink of death. So why did Gina's photo end up on Keyes' computer? The simple answer is that Gina's disappearance was a high-profile abduction of a teenage girl, something bound to come up when Keyes searched missing persons cases. Dig deeper, however, and perhaps Keyes came across Gina's case while looking for information on an Ohio victim. Remarkably, the case was not a case of a missing person, but a case of a victim. Remember, Ashley Nicole Summers, who also vanished from Cleveland and was once believed to have been abducted by the same person as Gina and Amanda, is also on The Nameless 45. For more information about Ashley, listen to the Nameless 45 episode we did on her case last year. There are two other people on The Nameless 45 from Ohio. Laurieann Boffman, who disappeared in August 2006 from Youngstown, and Tony Luzio of Delaware County, who went missing in July of 2005. In 2014, Luzio's vehicle and body were recovered from a pond. Boffman remains missing. Additionally, there is Pennsylvania resident Karen S. Adams, who disappeared from the border of West Virginia and Ohio with her cell phone last pinging in Steubenville, Ohio. We have covered Karen's case extensively on the show. Branch out even further, and you have Ali Lunsford, who disappeared from Weston, West Virginia in September 2011, and District Attorney Ray Grecar, who vanished near Penn State University in April of 2005. Not on The Nameless 45, but discussed at length on the podcast, is Lauren Spear, who vanished from Bloomington, Indiana just days before the couriers were murdered. We've also examined on the show, especially in episode 9 of season 2, how Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia comprise a hot spot near where Keys had family, guns, multiple indirect trips including periods where his phone was, and other things that were off, and more Nameless matches in any other area. Then there's the spring 2009 or 2010 sighting of Keys in Montpelier, Ohio, just 36 miles east, across the Ohio state line from Harlan, Indiana, where Heidi Keys was living at the time. We also covered this in season 2, but the gist is a woman believed Keys, posing as an insurance salesman, came onto Rapportch and asked for a phone book to look up a customer. The woman was leery of the man, and when she went to go get the book, her dog cornered the supposed salesman and he fled. All this is to say, considering these factors, it seems highly probable that there is at least one Keys victim in this region of the United States, which explains why Gina DeJesus' image appeared on Keys' computer. And quite mysteriously, Cleveland comes up just one time in Keys' timeline, on November 28th of 2007, when his credit card was charged for a luggage cart rental at the Cleveland airport. Oddly, and thus somewhat intriguingly, there are no corresponding charges or travel related to this, and this charge occurred just four months after Ashley Nicole Summers vanished, and could explain how many of these NamUs 45 cases ended up on his computer. If he did in fact abduct someone from the Cleveland area, and then googled Missing Ohio 2007, Ashley's case certainly would have come up, and Alia Lunsford's likely would have as well. In the 10 years since the miracle in Cleveland, Gina, Amanda, and Lily Rose have rebuilt their lives and found their own forms of healing. In 2015, Barry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from their high school. They also co-authored a book with journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan. Hope, a memoir of survival in Cleveland, became a New York Times bestseller. The harrowing memoir details the horrors the women endured as well as the lives they have reclaimed. In the opening of the book, they write, we have written here about terrible things that we never wanted to think about again. Now we want the world to know. We survived. We are free. We love life. With their unique experiences on the other side of a missing persons case, and as part of a small group of people freed from captivity, Amanda and Gina now advocate for those with missing loved ones. In 2018, Gina and her cousin Sylvia Colon founded the Cleveland Family Center for Missing Children and Adults. They offer a brick and mortar location for families to access support and resources. They also provide training to law enforcement on how to interact with families of the missing, including understanding and bridging cultural differences. Center also guides the public on how to support families and friends of the missing. The non-profit group is also part of the center. The non-profit provides all these services for free. This year, the center is hosting several events to raise awareness and to help more people. In the meantime, they continue to broadcast information about missing persons and support families as they navigate the criminal justice and media systems. May 6th of this year marked the 10th anniversary of the miracle in Cleveland. Gina, who typically prefers to remain out of the limelight, spoke to the press stating, I am a survivor and Seymour doesn't bother me. I want other people not to give up on hope and be a survivor just like me. I'm searching for life again. I'm searching for a new beginning. I'm searching for real again. I'm searching for love that never ends. Pain falling off like pain like the sun breaking through life's rays. It feels like magic dust from space. It's like a thrill that fills my heart. I'm searching for life again. This episode was written and researched by Michelle Tooker and produced, edited, and hosted by me, Josh Hallmark.
